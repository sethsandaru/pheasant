Pheasant is a dynamic CRUD Management which helps end-users to create the CRUD listing/form in seconds then use it with ease and fun.

Pheasant comes with 2 parts:
- API (this repo)
- Frontend (on paper/head)
  - (WIP) still thinking in the middle of Svelte and Vue ðŸ¤” Will make a decision after finished v0.0.1.

Pheasant is an open-source project and planned to deploy on CLOUD with 100% FREE usage. 
But if you don't want PheasantCloud keeping your data, feel free to clone and deploy for your own usage privately.

## Why?
- From high-level/end-users PoV: I want to manage data with ease with Good UI, I'm bored with Excel and stuff.
- From low-level/code-wise: CRUD mostly copy-paste, let's do less of that and Pheasant will help you.

## Dependencies
- Go 1.16+
